# Tier3 
This repository is combining a lot of smaller projects, sometimes the steps taken to reach a larger project.
The repo contains the following:-
## 1. Edge detection
Edge detection is a major part of computer vision. I wanted to understand it better, so decided to make a small project trying out different ways to implement my own edge detection.

#### Files
1. Single edge detection.ipynb

Motivation:
[Coursera course video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/lecture/4Trod/edge-detection-example)
This is the video from the CNN course that prompted me to try out edge detection implementation.

This notebook shows you how to detect a single edge in a image, either vertical or horizontal.
The data was generated inside the notebook itself, so no actual image was used.
